## Credits

Large amount of credit to https://randojs.com/, a script allowing for easy random function. This made writing my functions much simpler and (to my brain) more logical.
Credit to many many examples and similar functions I viewed on stackoverflow that I used as blueprints to put together this js code.
Additional credit to w3schools for helping me remember various js elements like operators https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp
